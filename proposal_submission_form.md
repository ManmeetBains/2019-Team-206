### 2019 BIG DATA HACKATHON PROPOSAL FORM

#### Team Number: 206  

#### Team Name: ET's NU Analytics Geeks    
  
#### Your teamâ€™s hackathon idea in TWO sentences:
##### Air pollution has been linked to learning disorders, memory problems, and depression, in addition to respiratory issues, but there is insufficient data in San Diego County for finite air-quality monitoring.
##### Creation of improved, cost-effective, real-time monitoring devices deployed at strategic locations will enable dynamic geolocational predictive analytics of indoor/outdoor air quality conditions for smart decision making.
  
#### Dataset(s) your team might use for the project (Provide name and URL):
- [EPA AirData Query https://aqs.epa.gov/api](https://aqs.epa.gov/api)

#### Team Coordinator GitHub Username: [mcvanderbilt](https://github.com/mcvanderbilt)
